# Manufacturing Facility Simulation
## Milestone 1
### By: Ryan Gaudreault, Omar Imran, Marcel LeClair

The Manufacturing Facility Simulation was conducted in Python.
There are two Python files associated with the simulation. The 
classes.py contains all the classes needed to run the simulation 
(i.e. Inspector, Workstation, Product, Component). The simulation should be run 
on Python 3.7 or above. 

##Installation Instructions
Python needs to be downloaded in order for the simulation to run. 
When downloading Python, it will ask to install "pip"  as well which 
should be installed, so the external libraries can be downloaded.
The simulation relies on the libraries NumPy and SimPy in order to run. 
To install these libraries, you need to have "pip" downloaded when downloading 
Python. </br>
Once pip is installed, in your terminal/command prompt, you need to 
type *pip install simpy* and *pip install numpy* to install these libraries. 

##Running The Simulation 
 The simulation can be run by using a Python IDE (i.e. PyCharm) or by typing
 *python main.py* in the terminal/command prompt while in the same folder as 
 main.py. This will run the main script and run the simulation until 2500 minutes.
